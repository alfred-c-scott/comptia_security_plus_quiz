<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>Using regular expressions and python, and copied and pasted data from a book of practice questions, I am aiming to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Copy and paste questions and multiple choice answer set into a data file
</li>
<li>
Import the data into a list of questions
</li>
<li>
Import Answers into a list of answers
</li>
<li>
Aggregate the data into two lists into a dictionary
</li>
<li>
Save the dictionary into a json
</li>
<li>
Create a multiple choice quiz
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At a later date I intend to create either a django or flask application utilizing this aggregated data
</p>
<h2>NOTE</h2>
<p>
* Due to Copyright and Intellectual Property considerations I will not be making the data files with the actual questions and answers public. However I will 
creating sample data files for others to test and verify that the program is working properly</p>
